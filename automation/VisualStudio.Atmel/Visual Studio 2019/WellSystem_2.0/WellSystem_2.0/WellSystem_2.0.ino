--Sensors--
-Water Preasure Sensor (analog value )
-Water Flow Sensor (return 1 or 0 each time, hall effect sensor)
-Well System Minimum Water Sensor (return 1 or zero)
-Exseption Water Heater when working 
-Button, Start Program after was stopped 

--Output Signals--
To a Pump (Water source from a ground)
To a Solenoid Valve (Water intake from paid source)
Bepper if out of water
